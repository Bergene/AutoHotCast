# AutoHotCast
 Minecraft fishingbot created in AutoHotkey. I found the original script on the Autohokey forum and decided to modify it as it was not working for me.


The biggest changes are: 
 1. Moved from ImageSearch to PixelSearch
 2. Reduces the search area drastically (outlined by a green square).
 3. Tweaked the flow of the code (Might try to change from labels to functions).

Planned changes:
 1. Make it possible to show/hide GUI.


Hotkeys:
 Shift+Alt+F - Toggle fishing - Bobber has to land in the green box, prefferably below the crosshair. Press hotkey again to stop fishing.
 Right Click - Stop fishing (Might remove this, it is a bit finicky).
 F4 - Panic button. Will teleport you home (I have not tested this myself).
 Shift+Alt+R - Reload App
 Shift+Alt+Q - Quit App
